**AetherSim** technically stands for ***A**dvanced and **E**xtensible **T**ransistor-level **H**ardware **E**xplorer and (relatively) **R**ealistic **Sim**ulator*, but it's basically an educational tool that allows you to explore digital circuits (think logic gates, computers, etc.) and simulate them.  However, it is worth noting that AetherSim's simulation tool is idealistic.  Signals travel between transistors instantaneously and the transistors are assumed to be ideal (e.g., they function as a switch that is either completely disconnected or short-circuited).  This means that AetherSim is *not* designed to do actual chip design or precise logic simulation.
